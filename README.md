# BeastDemo
My 3D Video-Game Demo project

## Notes
Yeah the code is messy. I know. But it is work-in-progress and I have never worked on it for more than a month without at least a month pause. Plus I did a lot of trying and testing stuff lately and it somehow became messy in the process. That's why I do plan on redesigning the whole thing once I get the animations working.

#### Future plans
- Make Animations work
- Redesign code to add scalability and robustness
- Take care of all the current memory leaks
- Create Level
- Add simple enemies
- Add simple gameplay

#### Copyright and stuff
All the assets are temporary. I do not own any rights to any of the assets. Only code is mine.
